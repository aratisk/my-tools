installed on lightsail using the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOGWl3G5pfI
in lightsail ,choose wordpress & get 1 month free.. also choose static ip as its free for upto 5. Then ssh and view the password inder home folder . use this to login

login using ipaddress/wp-admin and the username is 'user' and the password u found in previous step. then update the plugins. And setup a new user as admin

new wplogin 
setup new user, permanently delete all the default posts, pages and comments if any

wix,weebly,joomla,Drupal etc are other website builders but wordpress apparently is more flexible.
features: SEO friendly,responsive mobile websites,
wordpress is built on php and mysql. 
local host use: wampserver(windows only), xampp,mamp
So rather than install on AWS, another option is to install 1)mamp and 2)download wordpress.3)start boteh apache and my sql on MAMP.4)setup mysql from mamp 5)copy unzied wordpress to htdocs folder.
when loging in now , wordpress will ask for the mysql details to complete the setup. One problem might be that you cant install plugins directly from the wordpress. So workaround to download from wordpress.org and then manually upload plugin to wordpress
