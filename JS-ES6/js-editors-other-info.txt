var a = tempvalue;
alert(a); or even in document .getele.. (a) ==> does not need $var use..

ypu can declare var like this :
var fname,lname; rather than on seperate lines unless it needs initialisiation then do on seperate lines

check the difference btw num++ and num=num++

use shift+enter to write multi line code in console

=== or == for comparisons. also ! work for boolean
