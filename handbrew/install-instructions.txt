I installed on wsl (ubuntu). Took the isntall link off brew website and followed the instructions form the installation summaries.
Then followed instructions from here to installawsCLI --> Install instructions here : https://qiita.com/alokrawat050/items/56820afdb6968deec6a2

https://brew.sh/ --> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Output of above 
=========
==> Next steps:
- Add Homebrew to your PATH in /home/aratisk/.profile:
    echo 'eval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /home/aratisk/.profile
    eval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)
- Run `brew help` to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh
- Install the Homebrew dependencies if you have sudo access:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    See https://docs.brew.sh/linux for more information
- We recommend that you install GCC:
    brew install gcc
    
     brew install gcc (output)

==> Caveats
==> isl@0.18
isl@0.18 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

For compilers to find isl@0.18 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/include"
  
  ===
  Brew installation failed (because the python script was runing??) 
  So reinstalled using :
  
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
=====

You can now run: /usr/local/bin/aws --version

export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
