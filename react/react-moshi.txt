Angular is a complete framework while React is only a library.
so why do we isntall node? not because we use node, but only for the package manager : NPM
use sudo npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2 (specify the version here as we required a specific version)
extensions: 
simple react snippets by BUrke Holland
prettier - code formatter. by Esben Peterson
add --> "editor.formatOnSave":true
theme sued is ayu mirage
create-react-app react-app --> this installs dev server,webpack,babel.
npm run eject @ 10.22 in video
JSX is javascript xml. we write code in JSX as its sipler than react code. and Babel will compile the JSX to react code in the backend. 
serverwroker : basically serves files from cache in production env.
within index.js , you can do 
const element =<h1>hello world</h1>;
ReactDom.renderElement(element,document.getElementById("root"));
install bootstrap : npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
create a file under src --> components .create as .jsx file rather than .js file
code snippets shortcuts: imrc, cc
class counter extends component{
render(){
return <h1>hello world</h1>;
}
then in index.js import bootstrap, and counter. then in reactdom.reder replace <app /> with <counter />

multi cursor editing. select a word . then select c+d and it will seelct another occurence for you
instead of <div> as parent inside a return (), you can use <react.fragment>

return <span> {this.formatCount()} --> ie use {} to render values dynamically

and write fn
formatCount(){
const {count} = this.state;
return count === 0 ? <h1>zero</h1> : count;

fir the blue background bootstrap classes are : badge, badge-primary and set margin with m-2. others are badge-warning
for button : btn, btn-secondary, btn-sm. Also use className rather than class

if you want to use the style attribute rather than just classes then: the there are 2 methods to do it 
1)inline-styles: <span style={{ fontSize:30 }} ClassName="badge">
2) add a property called styles 
styles:{
fontSize:10
fontWeight:"bold"
}
<span style={this.styles } ClassName="badge">
Note the css propertiesa re in camelcase and the double bracket when doing inline styles. Also when u add 10 in fontSize, it automatically converts to 10px.
