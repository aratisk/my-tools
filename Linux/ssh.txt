setting up key based authentication rather than password based authentication:
public key lives on server that we will be ssh ing into ie the remote machine and private key remains with us
if you dont have a key use the following command on ur machine:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
this creates a ~/.ssh folder with 
id_rsa & id_rsa.pub
next copy over the id_rsa.pub to the remote server . either maually or scp. either way create a ~/.ssh folder on the remote machine if it does not exist. then scp using
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub userid@ipaddress:location-tocopy-to/file-name. you need passowrd to login now as key based autherntication is not setup yet.

complet this using the instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpk_1gldOAE

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install openssh-client

to check if ssh is running on server: 
sudo service ssh status
