You have Scrum and Kanban boards:
Scrum is more for working on new features towards a tight schedule for finishing work . Scrum has iterative sprints which are basically checkpoints for completion of batches of work. If any pending work ,reprioritise at the beginning of each sprint. 
whereas kanban agile is more for bugs that need delivery asap. Focus is on working in right order vs working towards a completion date. There is no backlog and it directly take you to the list of tasks.

create a Project. Try add only one project. Use containers for the modules. Its difficult for users to track tasks between projects.
create an epic
create a issue/ticket. issues=tickets. Break work into fragments and ownership of singular task and can repriorituse.. breaking into task : 1) a task >few hours but <1-3 days.
Backlog holds all the tickets. Like a holdall bucket until its assigned to a sprint etc.
create: containers,labels,sprints,epic etc.

epics are large stories with distinct start and end plus spans multiple sprints.contains stories,bugs,tasks 
stories, bugs, tasks are same hierarchy

Additional jobs for admin:


To divide the long list use : labels and components(both are lables)
Lables can be front end,back end. red team etc (can be created by anyone). IN our case : UI team, CS Team
Container created by admin. Can set component leads. Basically modules: eg numbertots, IN our case : Numbertots,Lesson Laps,TTC
Epics eg: production issues,user testing issues,new features (gives colours to it) : IN our case :user testing Fixes,new feature requests
Story points are added to a task to estimate how many tasks can be done in a sprint. its  measure of complexity - 3 being harder than 2 (1,2,3,5,8,13). to estimate team velocity ~(eg 15 is the number for a sprint) assign 1 day to be 3 etc
eg: 2-3 hours = 1 story point
biggest 3 days = 13 story point
workflow is the lifecycle of a ticket. transitions to help move between the boards. added a new board Blocked.
Boards are the status/stages of the tasks
Sprints are normally 2 weeks long. once active, no more added to it. Drag issues frm backlog for the sprint. IN our case :1.1 or A,b,c etc?

for numberfit:

we need folowing:
complexity
priority
dependency
TODO: slack bot integrate with jira
wy no priority is visible
