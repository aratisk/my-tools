moshi :
node is just an env for executing javascript. basically js was run in browsers. So dahl? took the v8 engine from chrome and build additional modules around it using c++ and this is node.
Node is asynchronous and an eg he mentioned paypal made a module using nodejs which required less code was faster. 

some global objects in node global objects:

console.log()
setTimeout()
clearTimeout()
setInterval()
clearInterval()

In browser window documentetc can be used. window represents the global scope. hence if you use any of the above global objects it defaults to window. eg: window.console.log()
if var message = ''; it become window.message
But since in node there is no window onj 'global' represents the global object so use global.console.log()
Also the message will be scoped to the file so global.message will return undefined.

module is not public but you can use 
module.exports.log = log (exporting a log function)
to import a module use 
const logger = require ('./logger'); --> returns and object and then invoke the log function on the object.
logger.log('msg');

another way is to export the function alone and not a object eg 
module.exports = log
and in the destination use:
logger = require ('./logger');
logger('msg'
jshint test??
