create a folder withut any space and all lower case
npx create-react-app .
after setup you need to use 1)npm start for dev and 2)npm start build for prod (builds, minifies and creates a prod version of our application that we can deploy onto a prod server).
the folders created are :1) modules : for the libraries. 2) public : has the html file --> index.html which just has a div element called root . No style sheets or script tags. Alll of our application is going to be added in the root div. React will generate the html and add it here. 3)src : all the js and css, test files,logos ie mostly everything that is part of the source files go in here. main files a)index.js which is where our application starts . ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')) b)App.js 
To start delete all the contents 1) App.js : return null in the function App(). remove the 2 imports other than react import. 2)remove test file ,css files and logo , service worker files etc so you are only left with App.js,index.js 3)remove serverworker related code and also remove all imports except react,reactDOM and App.
No we are ready to start and we normally start at the App.js . we will use JSX which is the React form of html. Install 'ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets' extension. now type 'rfc' and this creates a function component.
use <> </> ie a fragment to return multiple elements like <> <TodoList /> <input type="text" /> </>. This was used within the App.js for example.
import React, {useState} , from react
