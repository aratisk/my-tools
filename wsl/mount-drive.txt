Mount the drive with sudo mount -t drvfs M: /mnt/m
Note the letter of the network drive that you would like to map in WSL. We will use M: in this example.
Create a new folder for that drive letter under /mnt if it does not already exist. ( ex: mkdir /mnt/m )
Mount the drive with sudo mount -t drvfs M: /mnt/m.
