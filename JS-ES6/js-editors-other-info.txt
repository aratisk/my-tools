var a = tempvalue;
alert(a); or even in document .getele.. (a) ==> does not need $var use..

ypu can declare var like this :
var fname,lname; rather than on seperate lines unless it needs initialisiation then do on seperate lines

check the difference btw num++ and num=num++

use shift+enter to write multi line code in console

=== or == for comparisons. also ! work for boolean

to change the style through JS use style.fontsize = "200" . remeber to ad quotes
arrays : methods are:  .length. .push
objects {key : "value" , key2 : "value2"}. var car ={type="bmw",colour="white").. rather tahn index use car.colour. 
Arrays are numbered index while objects are named index. So if you need to acces using string use objects

document.getElementById and document.write

for loops for an array:
for (i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++){console.log(arr[i];}
var x; for (x of arr) { document.write(x +'<br>')
var i = 0; while (i < arr.length){ document.write(arr[i] +'<br>') i++
do while if u need executed atleadst once: do { document.write(arr[i] +'<br>'} while (i < arr.length)

Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
